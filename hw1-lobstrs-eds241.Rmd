#### DATA SOURCE:

Reed D. 2019. SBC LTER: Reef: Abundance, size and fishing effort for California Spiny Lobster (Panulirus interruptus), ongoing since 2012. Environmental Data Initiative. <https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/a593a675d644fdefb736750b291579a0>. Dataset accessed 11/17/2019.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Introduction**

You're about to dive into some deep data collected from five reef sites in Santa Barbara County, all about the abundance of California spiny lobsters! ðŸ¦ž Data was gathered by divers annually from 2012 to 2018 across Naples, Mohawk, Isla Vista, Carpinteria, and Arroyo Quemado reefs.

Why lobsters? Well, this sample provides an opportunity to evaluate the impact of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) established on January 1, 2012 (Reed, 2019). Of these five reefs, Naples, and Isla Vista are MPAs, while the other three are not protected (non-MPAs). Comparing lobster health between these protected and non-protected areas gives us the chance to study how commercial and recreational fishing might impact these ecosystems.

We will consider the MPA sites the `treatment` group and use regression methods to explore whether protecting these reefs really makes a difference compared to non-MPA sites (our control group). In this assignment, weâ€™ll think deeply about which causal inference assumptions hold up under the research design and identify where they fall short.

Letâ€™s break it down step by step and see what the data reveals! ðŸ“Š

![](figures/map-5reefs.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Anticipating potential sources of selection bias

**a.** Do the control sites (Arroyo Quemado, Carpenteria, and Mohawk) provide a strong counterfactual for our treatment sites (Naples, Isla Vista)? Write a paragraph making a case for why this comparison is centris paribus or whether selection bias is likely (be specific!).

The control sites may not provide a perfect counterfactual for the treatment sites due to potential selection bias. For example, using the centris paribus logic in this case means that the single difference between the two groups is whether or not they are an MPA. However, there may be other differences between the habitats, such as microclimate and/or proximity to town/cities. One can make a case that centris paribus logic may apply as the sites are relatively close together.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Read & wrangle data

**a.** Read in the raw data. Name the data.frame (`df`) `rawdata`

**b.** Use the function `clean_names()` from the `janitor` package

```{r}
# HINT: check for coding of missing values (`na = "-99999"`)

rawdata <- read_csv(here("data", 'spiny_abundance_sb_18.csv'), na = "-99999") %>%
    clean_names()
    
```

**c.** Create a new `df` named `tidyata`. Using the variable `site` (reef location) create a new variable `reef` as a `factor` and add the following labels in the order listed (i.e., re-order the `levels`):

```         
"Arroyo Quemado", "Carpenteria", "Mohawk", "Isla Vista",  "Naples"
```

```{r}
# Add long lables to our sites and save in a col named reef
tidydata <- rawdata %>% 
    mutate(reef = factor(site, 
                         levels = c("AQUE", "CARP", "MOHK",     "IVEE", "NAPL"), 
                         labels = c("Arroyo Quemado", "Carpenteria", "Mohawk", 
                                    "Isla Vista",  "Naples")))
```

Create new `df` named `spiny_counts`

**d.** Create a new variable `counts` to allow for an analysis of lobster counts where the unit-level of observation is the total number of observed lobsters per `site`, `year` and `transect`.

-   Create a variable `mean_size` from the variable `size_mm`
-   NOTE: The variable `counts` should have values which are integers (whole numbers).
-   Make sure to account for missing cases (`na`)!

**e.** Create a new variable `mpa` with levels `MPA` and `non_MPA`. For our regression analysis create a numerical variable `treat` where MPA sites are coded `1` and non_MPA sites are coded `0`

```{r}
#HINT(d): Use `group_by()` & `summarize()` to provide the total number of lobsters observed at each site-year-transect row-observation. 

#HINT(e): Use `case_when()` to create the 3 new variable columns

# assign each site either mpa or non-mpa, and 1 or 0
spiny_counts <- tidydata %>% 
    group_by(site, year, transect) %>% 
    summarise(count = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE), mean_size = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
    mutate(mpa = case_when(site %in% c("IVEE", "NAPL") ~ "MPA",
                           .default = "non_MPA")) %>% 
    mutate(treat = case_when(mpa == "MPA" ~ 1,
                             .default = 0)) %>% 
    ungroup()
```

> NOTE: This step is crucial to the analysis. Check with a friend or come to TA/instructor office hours to make sure the counts are coded correctly!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Explore & visualize data

**a.** Take a look at the data! Get familiar with the data in each `df` format (`tidydata`, `spiny_counts`)

```{r}
# Data Exploration
# First 5 rows of each
print(head(spiny_counts))
print(head(tidydata))

# Datatypes of each column
print(spiny_counts %>% summarise_all(class))
print(tidydata %>% summarise_all(class))
```

**b.** We will focus on the variables `count`, `year`, `site`, and `treat`(`mpa`) to model lobster abundance. Create the following 4 plots using a different method each time from the 6 options provided. Add a layer (`geom`) to each of the plots including informative descriptive statistics (you choose; e.g., mean, median, SD, quartiles, range). Make sure each plot dimension is clearly labeled (e.g., axes, groups).

-   [Density plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/density-plot-group-ggplot2)
-   [Ridge plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/ggridges/)
-   [Jitter plot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_jitter.html)
-   [Violin plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/violin-plot-group-ggplot2)
-   [Histogram](https://r-charts.com/distribution/histogram-density-ggplot2/)
-   [Beeswarm](https://r-charts.com/distribution/beeswarm/)

Create plots displaying the distribution of lobster **counts**:

1)  grouped by reef site
2)  grouped by MPA status
3)  grouped by year

Create a plot of lobster **size** :

4)  You choose the grouping variable(s)!

```{r}
# plot 1: Beeswarm Plot grouped by MPA status
spiny_counts %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = treat, y = count, color = mpa)) +
    geom_beeswarm(alpha = 0.5) +
    labs(title = 'Beeswarm Plot of Lobster Count per MPA status',
         x = 'MPA status',
         y = 'Lobster Count')+
    theme_minimal()+
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = treat, y = count, color = mpa), alpha =0.5) # Statistical summary present in boxplot
```

```{r}
# plot 2: Ridge plot grouped by Reef

spiny_counts %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = count, y = site, fill = site))+
    geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.8)+
     stat_summary(
        fun = median, 
        geom = "point",
        aes(shape = 'Median'), # Add in summary statistic, median
        color = "black", 
        size = 2
    )+
    theme_minimal() + 
    theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
     labs(title = 'Ridge Plot of Lobster Count per Reef',
         x = 'Lobster Count',
         y = 'Reef Site')
```

```{r}
# Plot 3: Histogram grouped by year (help)

spiny_counts %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = year, y = count)) + 
    geom_histogram(stat = 'identity',
                   fill = 'cornflowerblue', 
                   binwidth = 1) +
    labs(title = "Histogram of Lobster Counts by Year",
         x = "Year",
         y = "Lobster Count") +
    theme_minimal() +
    stat_summary(fun = spiny_counts$count(mean), 
                 geom = 'vline',
                 ) # average count 

# Add summary statistic
```

```{r}
# Plot 4: Jitter plot grouped by lobster size

spiny_counts %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = site,
           y = mean_size,
           color = site))+
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7)+
    geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) # summary statistics present in boxplot
```

**c.** Compare means of the outcome by treatment group. Using the `tbl_summary()` function from the package [`gt_summary`](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html)

```{r}
# USE: gt_summary::tbl_summary()

spiny_counts %>%
  dplyr::select(count, treat) %>%
  tbl_summary(
    by = treat,  # Group by MPA treatment status (0 or 1)
    statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ "{mean}"),  # Show mean 
    missing = "no"  # remove missing values
  ) %>%
  add_p(test = list(count ~ "t.test"))  # Perform t-test to compare means

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4: OLS regression- building intuition

**a.** Start with a simple OLS estimator of lobster counts regressed on treatment. Use the function `summ()` from the [`jtools`](https://jtools.jacob-long.com/) package to print the OLS output

**b.** Interpret the intercept & predictor coefficients *in your own words*. Use full sentences and write your interpretation of the regression results to be as clear as possible to a non-academic audience.

```{r}
# NOTE: We will not evaluate/interpret model fit in this assignment (e.g., R-square)

m1_ols <- lm(count ~ treat, spiny_counts)

summ(m1_ols, model.fit = FALSE) 

```

Interpretation: On average, there are 22.73 lobsters counted in non-MPA sites (intercept, or Beta 0) whereas MPA sites have 5.36 more lobsters on average compared to non-MPA sites (Beta 1). However, this difference could be due to chance (as our p-value is 0.3, not statistically significant).

**c.** Check the model assumptions using the `check_model` function from the `performance` package

**d.** Explain the results of the 4 diagnostic plots. Why are we getting this result?

```{r}
check_model(m1_ols,  check = "qq" )
```

Explanation: The deviations from the lines suggest the data is not normally distributed.

```{r}
check_model(m1_ols, check = "normality")
```

Explanation: The skew suggests that the data is not normally distributed.

```{r}
check_model(m1_ols, check = "homogeneity")
```

Explanation: The graph shows a more U-shaped curve which indicates that the variance of residuals is not constant across fitted values (heteroscedasticity), and this violates one of the assumptions of OLS. Additionally, the residuals are more extreme at either end, suggesting that the model predictions are less accurate for extreme values.

```{r}
check_model(m1_ols, check = "pp_check")
```

Explanation: As our observed data doesn't seem to match our model-predicted data that well, alternative models should be explored.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5: Fitting GLMs

**a.** Estimate a Poisson regression model using the `glm()` function

**b.** Interpret the predictor coefficient in your own words. Use full sentences and write your interpretation of the results to be as clear as possible to a non-academic audience.

```{r}
# Exponentiate the coefficients for more clear interpretation
exp(coef(m2_pois))

# Percentage change
(1.235956 - 1) * 100
```

On average, the expected lobster count in non-MPA areas is 22.729 lobsters. On average, the expected lobster count in MPA areas is 1.235 times greater than in non-MPA areas, meaning MPA areas have an approx 23.6% higher lobster count than non-MPA areas.

**c.** Explain the statistical concept of dispersion and overdispersion in the context of this model.

Dispersion refers to how far away data is from the mean. An assumption of the poisson model is that the variance and the mean are equal, and that the data is not overdispersed (variance greater than the mean). If the variance is greater than the mean, then a negative binomial regression should be used instead of poisson.

**d.** Compare results with previous model, explain change in the significance of the treatment effect

It is clear that OLS is not the best model for our data, as our data violates several of OLS' assumptions (such as normal distribution). The poisson model assesses a log-linear relationship, which appears to be more accurate for the data. However, depending on whether or not there is overdispersion, the standard errors in the poisson model may be inaccurate. This could make it seem that the change in significance was larger than it actually was.

```{r}
#HINT1: Incidence Ratio Rate (IRR): Exponentiation of beta returns coefficient which is interpreted as the 'percent change' for a one unit increase in the predictor 

#HINT2: For the second glm() argument `family` use the following specification option `family = poisson(link = "log")`

m2_pois <- glm(count ~ treat, spiny_counts, family = poisson(link = 'log'))

summary(m2_pois)

```

**e.** Check the model assumptions. Explain results.

The key model assumptions for poisson is that the daya must represent count data, the mean equals the variance (no overdispersion), there is a log-linear relationship, zero-inflation (no zero counts in the data), and observations must be independent of each other.

**f.** Conduct tests for over-dispersion & zero-inflation. Explain results.

```{r}
check_model(m2_pois)
```

```{r}
check_overdispersion(m2_pois)
```

```{r}
check_zeroinflation(m2_pois)
```

**g.** Fit a negative binomial model using the function glm.nb() from the package `MASS` and check model diagnostics

**h.** In 1-2 sentences explain rationale for fitting this GLM model.

As overdispersion was found to be present in the last step, a negative binomial regression model is a better option for a more accurate fitting compared to a poisson model.

**i.** Interpret the treatment estimate result in your own words. Compare with results from the previous model.

This model appears to be a better fit, as overdispersion is not occurring; however, the model is still over-fitting zeros.

```{r}
# NOTE: The `glm.nb()` function does not require a `family` argument

m3_nb <- glm.nb(count ~ treat, spiny_counts)

summary(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
check_overdispersion(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
check_zeroinflation(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
check_predictions(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
check_model(m3_nb)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 6: Compare models

**a.** Use the `export_summ()` function from the `jtools` package to look at the three regression models you fit side-by-side.

**c.** Write a short paragraph comparing the results. Is the treatment effect `robust` or stable across the model specifications.

There is variation in the treatment effect between the three models. The results of the OLS model show no statistically significant effect on lobster count in MPA vs non-MPA, where as both poisson and negative binomial regression both show statistically significant effects. The treatment effect is robust and/or stable across both the poisson and negative binomial regression analysis, but not OLS.

```{r}
# Position 3 models side by side
export_summs(list(m1_ols, m2_pois, m3_nb),
             model.names = c("OLS","Poisson", "NB"),
             statistics = "none")

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 7: Building intuition - fixed effects

**a.** Create new `df` with the `year` variable converted to a factor

**b.** Run the following negative binomial model using `glm.nb()`

-   Add fixed effects for `year` (i.e., dummy coefficients)

-   Include an interaction term between variables `treat` & `year` (`treat*year`)

**c.** Take a look at the regression output. Each coefficient provides a comparison or the difference in means for a specific sub-group in the data. Informally, describe the what the model has estimated at a conceptual level (NOTE: you do not have to interpret coefficients individually)

**d.** Explain why the main effect for treatment is negative? \*Does this result make sense?

```{r}
ff_counts <- spiny_counts %>% 
    mutate(year=as_factor(year))
    
m5_fixedeffs <- glm.nb(
    count ~ 
        treat +
        year +
        treat*year,
    data = ff_counts)

summ(m5_fixedeffs, model.fit = FALSE)
```

**e.** Look at the model predictions: Use the `interact_plot()` function from package `interactions` to plot mean predictions by year and treatment status.

**f.** Re-evaluate your responses (c) and (b) above.

```{r}

interact_plot(m5_fixedeffs, pred = year, modx = treat,
              outcome.scale = "link") # NOTE: y-axis on log-scale

# HINT: Change `outcome.scale` to "response" to convert y-axis scale to counts
```

**g.** Using `ggplot()` create a plot in same style as the previous `interaction plot`, but displaying the original scale of the outcome variable (lobster counts). This type of plot is commonly used to show how the treatment effect changes across discrete time points (i.e., panel data).

The plot should haveâ€¦ - `year` on the x-axis - `counts` on the y-axis - `mpa` as the grouping variable

```{r}
# Hint 1: Group counts by `year` and `mpa` and calculate the `mean_count`
# Hint 2: Convert variable `year` to a factor

plot_counts <- 

# plot_counts %>% ggplot() ...
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 8: Reconsider causal identification assumptions

a.  Discuss whether you think `spillover effects` are likely in this research context (see Glossary of terms; <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RIudsVcYhWGpqC-Uftk9UTz3PIq6stVyEpT44EPNgpE/edit?usp=sharing>)

b.  Explain why spillover is an issue for the identification of causal effects

c.  How does spillover relate to impact in this research setting?

d.  Discuss the following causal inference assumptions in the context of the MPA treatment effect estimator. Evaluate if each of the assumption are reasonable:

    1)  SUTVA: Stable Unit Treatment Value assumption
    2)  Excludability assumption

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# EXTRA CREDIT
